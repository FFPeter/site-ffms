Gluon versions used for  Münster Freifunk Firmware builds
Forked from the Lübecker Config by https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/site-ffhl

The version number is derived from the used gluon version and will be siffixed with an 
increasing build number. 

Merges and commits to branch 'master' will trigger a build a our central buildserver which 
results in a version which can be deployed by the autoupdater functionality. 

For manual builds the script 'build-test.sh' can be used.
